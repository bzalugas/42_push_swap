* 42's push_swap project
The goal of this project is to create a program that takes a list of integers as intputs and displays the operations to sort the list. The numbers are manipulated in a stack and sorted with the help of a second stack.
** Possible operations
- *sa* (swap a): swap the first 2 elements of stack a
- *sb* (swap b): same but on b
- *ss*: sa & sb at the same time
- *pa* (push a): push the first element of a to b
- *pb* (push b): same but from b to a
- *ra* (rotate a): shift up all elements by 1. \to first element becomes last.
- *rb* (rotabe b): same in b
- *rr*: ra & rb
- *rra* (reverse rotate a): shift down all elements by 1. \to last element becomes first.
- *rrb* (reverse rotate b): same in b
- *rrr*: rra & rrb
